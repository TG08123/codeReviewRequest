**Project Description:** This application allows a user to select a PowerPoint template and CSV file (generated via a SharePoint 2016 calendar export) with dates and events, in addition to a report start date. The application reads in the selected CSV file, parses the data within, and fills in the selected PowerPoint slide template accordingly. 




**Note:** This was a custom solution developed for a specific use case. A PowerPoint template and CSV file that can be used to test this application will be added to the repo.
